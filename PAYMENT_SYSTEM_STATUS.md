# Payment System Status - Fixed Database Schema Issues

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. âœ… Missing `payment_status` Column

**Fix Applied**: Modified payment functions to handle missing column gracefully
**Migration Updated**: Added `payment_status` column to migration script

### 2. âœ… Incorrect Phone Column Names
**Error**: `column companies.phone does not exist` (hint: use phone1 or phone2)
**Fix Applied**: Updated all queries to use `phone1` and `phone2` columns
**Affected Functions**: Credit reports, receipt generation

### 3. âœ… Missing Database Columns
**Error**: Various PGRST204 and 42703 errors for missing columns
**Fix Applied**: All functions now handle missing columns gracefully
**Migration Ready**: Comprehensive migration script available

## Current Payment System Status

### âœ… **Fully Working Features:**
- **Payment Recording**: Outstanding payments can be recorded without errors
- **Basic Status Tracking**: Payment attempts are logged (even without status column)
- **Error Prevention**: No more crashes when recording payments
- **Credit Reports**: Load successfully with available data
- **Receipt Generation**: Works with available billing information

### ðŸŸ¡ **Limited Features (Until Migration):**
- **Payment Status Updates**: Status changes not stored in database

   - Provides meaningful error messages

2. **`getCreditReports()`**:
   - Uses correct phone column names (`phone1`, `phone2`)
   - Handles missing credit data gracefully
   - Provides fallback calculations

3. **`generateReceipt()`**:
