# Outstanding Payment System Enhancement - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive outstanding payment system that automatically updates balances, provides real-time feedback, and handles partial payments correctly.

## ‚úÖ **1. Fixed Database Schema Issues**

### Email Column Errors Fixed:
**Issue**: `column companies.email does not exist` (hint: use email1 or email2)
**Solution**: Updated all queries to use correct email column names
- **Companies**: Now uses `email1` and `email2` columns
- **Individuals**: Now uses `email1` and `email2` columns
- **Credit Reports**: Fixed to use `company.email1 || company.email2`
- **Receipt Generation**: Updated to use correct email references

### Phone Column References:
- **Companies**: Uses `phone1` and `phone2` columns

## ‚úÖ **2. Outstanding Amount Calculation System**

### New `calculateOutstandingAmounts()` Function:

- **Accurate Balances**: `Outstanding = Total Invoice - Sum of Payments`
- **Graceful Handling**: Works even if `advance_payments` table doesn't exist
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient batch processing for multiple invoices

### Key Features:
```javascript
// For each invoice:
totalPaid = sum(all payments from advance_payments table)
outstandingAmount = max(0, totalAmount - totalPaid)
isFullyPaid = (outstandingAmount === 0)
```
