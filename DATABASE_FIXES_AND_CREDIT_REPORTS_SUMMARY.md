# Database Fixes and Credit Reports System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved critical database schema issues and implemented a comprehensive Credit Reports system for tracking client credit limits, utilization, and payment patterns.

## 1. ✅ Fixed Database Schema Issues

### Issues Resolved:
- **PGRST204 Error**: Fixed missing `last_payment_date` column in `service_billings` table
- **42703 Error**: Fixed missing `credit_limit_days` column in `companies` and `individuals` tables
- **Payment System Errors**: Resolved advance payment recording failures

### Database Migration Created:
- **File**: `database/fix_missing_columns.sql`
- **Comprehensive Migration**: Adds all missing columns with proper constraints and indexes
- **Safety Features**: Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses to prevent errors on re-execution
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes indexes for better query performance

### Columns Added:
- `service_billings.paid_amount` (DECIMAL) - Track payment amounts
- `service_billings.last_payment_date` (DATE) - Track last payment date
- `service_billings.card_id` (UUID) - Link to payment cards
- `companies.credit_limit_days` (INTEGER) - Credit term days
- `individuals.credit_limit_days` (INTEGER) - Credit term days

### API Fixes:
- **Modified**: `recordAdvancePayment()` - Graceful handling of missing columns
- **Modified**: `getDues()` - Removed reference to non-existent `credit_limit_days`
- **Enhanced**: Error handling for database schema mismatches
