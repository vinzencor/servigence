# Database Migration Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The payment system was failing with the following errors:
- `PGRST204: Could not find the 'last_payment_date' column of 'service_billings' in the schema cache`
- `42703: column companies_1.credit_limit_days does not exist`

## Solution Applied
I have modified the payment functions to work gracefully without the missing database columns, but for full functionality, you need to execute the database migration.

## Temporary Workaround (Currently Active)
The payment system now works with these limitations:
- ✅ Payment status updates work (pending → partial → paid)
- ✅ Payment recording works (stored in advance_payments table if it exists)
- ✅ Basic payment functionality is restored
- ⚠️ `paid_amount` tracking is limited until migration
- ⚠️ `last_payment_date` is not stored until migration
- ⚠️ Credit reports may have limited data until migration

## To Restore Full Functionality

### Step 1: Execute Database Migration
Run the SQL script located at: `database/fix_missing_columns.sql`

**In Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor"
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database/fix_missing_columns.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

**Or via Supabase CLI:**
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success
After running the migration, verify these columns exist:

**service_billings table:**
- `paid_amount` (DECIMAL)
- `last_payment_date` (DATE)
- `card_id` (UUID)

**companies table:**
- `credit_limit_days` (INTEGER)

**individuals table:**
- `credit_limit_days` (INTEGER)

**advance_payments table:**
- Complete table with all payment tracking fields

### Step 3: Test Payment Functionality
1. Try recording a payment in Outstanding Reports
2. Verify payment history shows correctly
3. Check that credit reports load without errors
4. Confirm receipt generation works

## What the Migration Adds

### New Columns:
- `service_billings.paid_amount` - Track total paid amount per invoice
- `service_billings.last_payment_date` - Track when last payment was made
- `service_billings.card_id` - Link payments to specific cards
- `companies.credit_limit_days` - Credit term days for companies
- `individuals.credit_limit_days` - Credit term days for individuals

### New Table:
- `advance_payments` - Complete payment transaction history

### Indexes and Constraints:
- Performance indexes on payment-related columns
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- RLS policies for security

## Benefits After Migration

### Enhanced Payment Tracking:
- ✅ Accurate paid amount tracking per invoice
- ✅ Payment history with full details
- ✅ Last payment date tracking
- ✅ Professional receipt generation

### Credit Management:
- ✅ Complete credit reports with utilization tracking
- ✅ Credit limit days for payment terms
- ✅ Risk assessment based on payment patterns
- ✅ Outstanding amount calculations

### Improved Performance:
- ✅ Optimized queries with proper indexes
- ✅ Faster credit report generation
- ✅ Better payment history retrieval

## Current Status
- 🟡 **Payment System**: Working with limitations
- 🟡 **Credit Reports**: Working with basic data
- 🟡 **Outstanding Reports**: Working with status updates
- 🔴 **Full Payment Tracking**: Requires migration
- 🔴 **Complete Credit Analysis**: Requires migration

## Next Steps
1. **Execute the migration** using the SQL script
2. **Test all payment functionality** to ensure everything works
3. **Verify credit reports** show complete data
4. **Train users** on the enhanced payment features

The system is currently functional for basic payment operations, but executing the migration will unlock the full potential of the payment and credit management system.
